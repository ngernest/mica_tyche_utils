# Tyche Utils for Mica

This repo contains a small library for creating JSON files that are ingested by [Tyche](https://github.com/tyche-pbt/) for visualizing test results produced by [Mica](https://github.com/ngernest/mica) (see [`tyche_utils.ml`](./lib/mica_tyche_utils.ml)). 

- Note: the Tyche-Mica integration is still work in progress (contact [Ernest Ng](mailto:ernest@cs.cornell.edu) for more details).
- For more details about Tyche, we refer the reader to the [UIST '24 paper by Goldstein et al](https://harrisongoldste.in/papers/uist24-tyche.pdf).
